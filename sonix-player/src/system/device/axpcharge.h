// has no MP2731. The percentage limit in power.c needs the MP2731's node, so on
// this player there are two switches instead, both written to the PMIC over
// I2C (bus 0, address 0x34):
//
//   * the charge limit: target voltage 4.20 V instead of the stock 4.40 V
//     (REG64h). The charge tapers off and ends on its own at the lower
//     ceiling, around 80%; the charger itself is never switched off.
//   * the current limit: charge current at most 500 mA (REG62h). Never raises
//     a current that is already lower.
//
// Switching either off writes back what was there before. Both are asserted
// again every few seconds from the power tick.

// True on a player charged by the PMIC alone: by the model table when
// system-info.json names one, otherwise by the MP2731's node being absent.
